# Sqlalchemy-challenge  
## Scope  
For this activity we were given a dataset on SQLite and the main task was to connect to the DB using Python/Pandas and summarize general information of the dataset, plot a bar chart of the precipitation values for the most recent year on the dataset, plot a histogram of the temperature observed for the most observed station and show the statistics and data frames generated in Pandas on my own API using Flask.  
## Results
Plot of the last 12 months of precipitation data.
